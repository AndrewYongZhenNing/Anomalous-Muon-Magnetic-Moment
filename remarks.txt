Here I will write some remarks aboutthe papers and books from the folder to prevent ambiguities during future use.

part_iii_essays.pdf : information about aims and objectives of the essay I am writing

Muon (g-2): Experiment and Theory.pdf : a long review about current progress in calculating g-2, both in experimental efforts and theory

Quantum Chromodynamics on the Lattice.pdf : a textbook I am currently using to learn about lattice field theory and (hopefully) later on LQCD

The Harodnic Vacuum Polarization Contribution ot the Muon g-2 from Lattice QCD.pdf : A paper I have started, which is about calculations of HVP

lattice calculation of the lowest order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment.pdf : a 2008 review showing me how to calculate the first order correction that makes g-2 nonzero (reading in progress as of 19:58 18.02.18

Final Report of the Muon 3821 Anomalous Magnetic Moment Measurement at BNL.pdf : an experimental paper that highlights the values measured now (can be compared to theory), and explains the experimental setup

The Measurement of the Anomalous Muon Magnetic Moment at Fermilab.pdf : another experimental paper (more recent 2015) that talks about experimental measurements
